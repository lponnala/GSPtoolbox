# GSPtoolbox


#### Installation

Add the GSPtools directory to MATLAB's search path, so that MATLAB can find its contents when run. 
The easiest way to do this is as follows:


1. Start MATLAB
2. Go to 'File' in the upper left-hand corner
3. Select 'Set Path'
4. Click on 'Add folder' tab on the left side, navigate to the GSPtools directory and select it


You should now be able to call the GSP toolbox functions from any other directory on your computer. 


#### Description

The hybridization of the exposed 3' portion of the 16S tail with the mRNA sequence produces a free energy
signal. It can be calculated using J. D. Starmer's 'Free2Bind' software, available at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/free2bind


The GSP toolbox contains software written in MATLAB to analyze these free energy signals.


The 'GSPtools' directory contains functions that perform specific tasks, such as detecting f=1/3, 
estimating signal parameters and calculating displacement. Type 'help function_name' at the MATLAB 
command prompt for more information on each function.
